Introduction to Programming in Java
===================


[**Textbook**][1] is Introduction to Programming in Java is an interdisciplinary approach to the traditional CS1 curriculum. This book teach all of the classic elements of programming, using an "objects-in-the-middle" approach that emphasizes data abstraction. A key feature of the book is the manner in which we motivate each programming concept by examining its impact on specific applications, taken from fields ranging from materials science to genomics to astrophysics to internet commerce. The book is organized around four stages of learning to program.




> - [**Chapter 1:** Elements of Programming][2] introduces variables; assignment statements; built-in types of data; conditionals and loops; arrays; and input/output, including graphics and sound.
> - [**Chapter 2:** Functions][3] introduces modular programming. We stress the fundamental idea of dividing a program into components that can be independently debugged, maintained, and reused.
> - [**Chapter 3:** Object-Oriented Programming][4] introduces data abstraction. We emphasize the concept of a data type and its implementation using Java's class mechanism.
> - [**Chapter 4:** Algorithms and Data Structures][5] introduces classical algorithms for sorting and searching, and fundamental data structures, including stacks, queues, and symbol tables.
