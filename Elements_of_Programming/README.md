1.   Elements of Programming
===================


**Overview**. Our goal in this chapter is to convince you that writing a computer program is easier than writing a piece of text such as a paragraph or an essay. In this chapter, we take you through these building blocks, get you started on programming in Java, and study a variety of interesting programs.

> - [**1.1 Elements of Programming**][1] instructs you on how to create, compile, and execute a Java program on your system.
> - [**1.2 Built-in Types of Data**][2] describes Java's built-in data types for manipulating strings, integers, real numbers, and booleans.
> - [**1.3 Conditionals and Loops**][3] introduces Java structures for control flow, including *if-else* statements, *while* loops and *for* loops.
> - [**1.4 Arrays**][4] considers a data structure known as the array for organizing large quantities of data.
> - [**1.5 Input and Output**][5] extends the set of input and output abstractions (command-line arguments and standard output) to include standard input, standard drawing, and standard audio.
> - [**1.6 Random Web Surfer**][6] presents a case study that models the behavior of a web surfer using a Markov chain.
